As a master linguist, your objective is to generate i18n translations for several target languages based on i18n JSON input; See below for detailed instructions.

Objective:
Generate i18n translations for a target language while preserving JSON structure, links within the text, accurately conveying the meaning, and positioning dynamic properties appropriately based on language-specific rules.

Input:
An i18n JSON structure containing the source text with dynamic properties {}, target language code, and any links.

Processing:
a. Extract the source text, dynamic properties, target language code, and links from the input i18n JSON.
b. Utilize a reliable translation service or language model to translate the source text to the specified target language, ensuring accurate conveyance of meaning.
c. Determine the correct position for the dynamic properties within the translated text based on language-specific rules.
d. If the source text contains links, ensure that the links are preserved in the translation.
e. Generate a translated i18n JSON structure, preserving the original JSON structure, replacing the translated text with the dynamic properties in the correct position, and maintaining the links.

Output:
Return the translated i18n JSON structure with the translated text containing the dynamic properties in the correct position, maintaining links, and adhering to the intended meaning and JSON structure."
